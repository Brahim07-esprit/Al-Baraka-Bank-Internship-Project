# Al Baraka Bank Chatbot

This project is a real-time chatbot developed for **Al Baraka Bank** during my internship. It is designed to enhance customer engagement by providing 24/7 support, answering common queries, and improving user satisfaction. The chatbot was built using **Node NLP**, **Express**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and features a backend analysis system written in **Python** to track and improve its performance.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Users can chat with the bot in real-time for instant support and information.
- **Multilingual Support**: Currently, the chatbot can handle queries in **French** with room to expand to other languages.
- **Advanced NLP**: Using **Node NLP**, the bot understands user intents and responds accurately to different queries.
- **24/7 Availability**: The chatbot is available anytime, improving customer engagement by offering round-the-clock support.
- **Performance Analysis**: A Python script analyzes chatbot conversations to track successful queries and identify areas for improvement.

### How It Works

1. **Chatbot Logic**: 
   - The chatbot uses **Node NLP** to process incoming queries and provide appropriate responses based on predefined documents and answers.
   - It currently supports several intents, such as mood detection, greeting, account opening information, and more.
  
2. **Real-Time Communication**:
   - The chatbot runs on an **Express** server with **Socket.IO** to enable real-time communication between users and the bot.

3. **Performance Tracking**:
   - A **Python** script is used in the backend to track the chatbot's performance. It records successful and unsuccessful interactions to improve the bot's accuracy over time.

### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Server-side environment
- **Express**: Web framework for building the chatbot server
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication between the bot and users
- **Node NLP**: Natural Language Processing library to process and understand user inputs
- **Python**: Script for analyzing bot performance and improving accuracy
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Frontend design and functionality of the chatbot interface

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone this repository
